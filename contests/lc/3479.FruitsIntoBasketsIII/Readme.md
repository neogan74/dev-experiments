# [3479. Fruits Into Baskets III](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruits-into-baskets-iii)

You are given two arrays of integers, `fruits` and `baskets`, each of length `n`, where:

- `fruits[i]` represents the quantity of the `i-th` type of fruit.
- `baskets[j]` represents the capacity of the `j-th` basket.

## Placement Rules

Place the fruits from left to right following these rules:

1. **Each fruit type** must be placed in the **leftmost available basket** with a capacity **greater than or equal** to the quantity of that fruit type.
2. **Each basket** can hold **only one type of fruit**.
3. If a fruit type **cannot be placed** in any basket, it **remains unplaced**.

## Task

Return the **number of fruit types** that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.

## Example 1

> **Input:**
>
> `fruits = [4, 2, 5]`
>
> `baskets = [3, 5, 4]`
>
> **Output:**
>`1`
>
> **Explanation:**
>
> - `fruits[0] = 4` is placed in `baskets[1] = 5`.
> - `fruits[1] = 2` is placed in `baskets[0] = 3`.
> - `fruits[2] = 5` cannot be placed (no basket with capacity â‰¥ 5 is available).
>
> So, we return `1`.

## Example 2

> **Input:**
>
> `fruits = [3, 6, 1]`  
>
> `baskets = [6, 4, 7]`
>
> **Output:** `0`
>
> **Explanation:**  
>
> - `fruits[0] = 3` is placed in `baskets[0] = 6`.
> - `fruits[1] = 6` is placed in `baskets[2] = 7`.
> - `fruits[2] = 1` is placed in `baskets[1] = 4`.
>
> All fruits are placed successfully, so we return `0`.

## Constraints

- `n == fruits.length == baskets.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= fruits[i], baskets[i] <= 10^9`
