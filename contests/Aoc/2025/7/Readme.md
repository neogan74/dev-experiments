# Day 7: Laboratories

You leave the trash compactor and step into a teleporter lab. The teleporter sputters, dumping you into a sealed room. Diagnostics show error `0H-N0`, pointing to a faulty tachyon manifold. The diagram of the manifold (your puzzle input) shows how a downward-moving tachyon beam behaves.

## Mechanics
- The grid uses `S` for the entry point, `.` for empty space, and `^` for splitters.
- Beams always travel downward one row at a time.
- When a beam enters a splitter `^`, that beam stops and two new beams continue downward from the immediate left and right positions of the splitter (starting on the splitter’s row).
- Beams that move beyond the left/right edges simply disappear; beams can overlap without issue.
- The goal is to count how many times beams are split before all beams exit the manifold.

## Example
Input:
```
.......S.......
...............
.......^.......
...............
......^.^......
...............
.....^.^.^.....
...............
....^.^...^....
...............
...^.^...^.^...
...............
..^...^.....^..
...............
.^.^.^.^.^...^.
...............
```

Result: the incoming beam is split **21** times.

## Task
Analyze your manifold diagram (see `input.txt`) and report the total number of beam splits.
