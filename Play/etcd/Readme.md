## **Etcd Mastery Plan (4-6 weeks)**

### **Week 1: Setup & Basics**

**Days 1-2: Installation & Single Node**
- Install etcd locally
- Explore etcdctl commands (put, get, del)
- Understand key-value basics, prefixes, and ranges
- Experiment with TTLs and key expiration
- Try JSON vs binary values

**Days 3-4: Cluster Setup**
- Set up a 3-node cluster (local or Docker)
- Understand cluster membership
- Practice adding/removing members
- Observe leader election (check which node is leader)

**Days 5-7: Core Operations**
- Test different consistency levels (serializable vs linearizable reads)
- Experiment with transactions (if/then/else operations)
- Use compare-and-swap (CAS) for atomic updates
- Create and manage leases
- Attach keys to leases and observe behavior

### **Week 2: Advanced Features**

**Days 1-3: Watch Mechanism**
- Set up basic watches on keys and prefixes
- Test watch with historical revisions
- Handle watch cancellation and resumption
- Experiment with watch filters
- Build a simple app that reacts to etcd changes

**Days 4-5: Authentication & Security**
- Enable authentication
- Create users and roles
- Set up role-based access control (RBAC)
- Test permission denials
- Enable TLS for secure communication

**Days 6-7: Mini Project #1**
Build a **distributed configuration service**:
- Store app configs in etcd
- Multiple apps watch for config changes
- Hot-reload configs without restart

### **Week 3: Distributed Patterns**

**Days 1-2: Service Discovery**
Build a service discovery system:
- Services register themselves with leases
- Services watch for peer availability
- Handle service failures (lease expiration)

**Days 3-4: Distributed Locking**
Implement distributed locks:
- Create locks using leases and transactions
- Handle lock timeouts
- Test lock contention with multiple clients
- Implement lock queuing

**Days 5-7: Leader Election**
Build leader election:
- Multiple processes compete for leadership
- Leader holds a lease
- Followers watch and take over on failure
- Test failover scenarios

### **Week 4: Failure Scenarios & Operations**

**Days 1-3: Chaos Testing**
- Kill the leader node, observe election
- Partition the network (split brain scenarios)
- Test with 2 nodes down in 5-node cluster
- Observe write failures during minority
- Test client behavior during failures

**Days 4-5: Backup & Recovery**
- Create snapshots
- Restore from snapshots
- Test disaster recovery scenarios
- Understand compaction and defragmentation

**Days 6-7: Performance & Monitoring**
- Use etcd metrics and Prometheus
- Test performance limits (write throughput)
- Observe memory usage with large datasets
- Test watch scalability (many watchers)

### **Week 5-6: Complex Use Cases**

**Project #2: Job Queue/Scheduler**
- Distributed task queue using etcd
- Multiple workers claiming jobs (using transactions)
- Job status tracking
- Handle worker failures

**Project #3: Coordination Service**
- Implement distributed barriers
- Create semaphores (limit concurrent access)
- Build a distributed counter
- Implement priority queues

**Corner Cases to Test:**

- **Network partitions**: Isolate leader from followers
- **Slow followers**: Simulate network latency
- **Rapid leader changes**: Kill leaders repeatedly
- **Lease edge cases**: What happens at exact expiration?
- **Large values**: Test limits (default 1.5MB)
- **Many keys**: Stress test with 100K+ keys
- **Watch storms**: Many clients watching same key
- **Revision overflow**: Understand revision limits
- **Clock skew**: Test with out-of-sync clocks
- **Disk full**: What happens when storage fills up?

### **Daily Practices:**

- **Keep a learning journal** - Document surprises and "aha!" moments
- **Read logs** - Understand what etcd logs during operations
- **Experiment freely** - Break things intentionally
- **Compare with docs** - Verify behavior matches documentation

### **Tools to Use:**

- `etcdctl` - Primary CLI tool
- Docker Compose - Easy multi-node setup
- Go/Python client libraries - For building projects
- `tcpdump` or Wireshark - Observe network traffic
- Chaos engineering tools (optional) - For advanced failure testing

After completing this plan, you'll have deep practical knowledge of etcd's behavior, edge cases, and design philosophy - perfect foundation for building your clone!
