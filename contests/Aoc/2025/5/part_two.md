## --- Part Two ---

The Elves start bringing their spoiled inventory to the trash chute at the back of the kitchen.

To stop pestering you whenever new inventory arrives, they want to know every ID that the fresh ingredient ID ranges deem fresh. An ingredient ID counts as fresh if it appears in at least one range.

The second section of the database (the available ingredient IDs) is now irrelevant. Using the same example, the fresh ingredient ID ranges are:

- 3-5
- 10-14
- 16-20
- 12-18

These ranges mark the following ingredient IDs as fresh:

`3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20`

So, in this example, the fresh ingredient ID ranges consider a total of 14 ingredient IDs to be fresh.

Process the database file again. How many ingredient IDs are considered to be fresh according to the fresh ingredient ID ranges?
