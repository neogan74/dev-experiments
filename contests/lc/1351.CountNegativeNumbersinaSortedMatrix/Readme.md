# [1351. Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-negative-numbers-in-a-sorted-matrix/description)

## Problem
Given an `m x n` matrix `grid` sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return the number of negative numbers in `grid`.

## Examples
```
Input:  grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negative numbers in the matrix.
```

```
Input:  grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
Output: 0
```

## Constraints
- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- -100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100

## Follow up
Could you find an O(m + n) solution?
