# [1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-integer-divisible-by-k/description)

Find the length of the smallest positive integer `n` made only of the digit `1` that is divisible by `k`. If no such number exists, return `-1`. The value of `n` may exceed 64-bit limits.

## Examples
- `k = 1` -> `1` (smallest `n` is `1`)
- `k = 2` -> `-1` (no all-ones number is divisible by `2`)
- `k = 3` -> `3` (smallest `n` is `111`)

## Constraints
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`
