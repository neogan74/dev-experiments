# [31. Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/description/)

## Problem
A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order. The next permutation of an array is the next lexicographically greater arrangement. If no greater arrangement exists, rearrange the array into the lowest possible order (ascending).

The change must be in-place using constant extra memory.

## Examples
- Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`  
  Output: `[1,3,2]`
- Input: `nums = [3,2,1]`  
  Output: `[1,2,3]`
- Input: `nums = [1,1,5]`  
  Output: `[1,5,1]`

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
