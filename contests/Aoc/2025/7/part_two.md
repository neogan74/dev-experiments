# Part Two

The manifold turns out to be **quantum**, not classical. A single tachyon particle is fired, but at every splitter `^` it takes *both* the left and right paths: time itself forks into separate timelines.

Your job is to count how many timelines exist after the particle finishes every possible path through the manifold.

## Mechanics
- Still use `S` as the entry, `.` as empty space, `^` as a splitter.
- The particle moves downward one row at a time.
- Hitting `^` forks the current timeline into two: one continues from the cell left of the splitter, the other from the cell right of the splitter (starting on the splitter’s row). If a branch steps outside the grid, it vanishes.
- Timelines never merge; overlapping positions are separate timelines.
- Count all timelines that survive to the end of the grid.

## Example
Input:
```
.......S.......
...............
.......^.......
...............
......^.^......
...............
.....^.^.^.....
...............
....^.^...^....
...............
...^.^...^.^...
...............
..^...^.....^..
...............
.^.^.^.^.^...^.
...............
```

Some possible timelines include:
- Always choosing left at every splitter.
- Alternating left then right at each splitter.
- Reaching the same final cell as the alternating path via a different route.

Total timelines in this example: **40**.

## Task
Using the many-worlds model, determine how many distinct timelines a single particle creates for your manifold (`input.txt` or another input file).
